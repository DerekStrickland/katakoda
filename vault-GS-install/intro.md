[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing.

Vault must first be installed on your machine. Vault is distributed as a [binary package](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html) for all supported platforms and architectures. This page will not cover how to compile Vault from source, but compiling from source is covered in the [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/index.html) for those who want to be sure they're compiling source they trust into the final binary.
