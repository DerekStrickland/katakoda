Now that you have implemented create, you must implement read to retrieve the resource current state. This will be run during the `plan` process to determine whether the resource needs to be updated.

The read function:
1. retrieves API Client from meta parameter
1. retrieves order ID
1. invokes the GetOrder function on the HashiCups client
1. maps response (`hc.Order`) to order `schema.Resource`

Since `hc.Order` is a nested object, you will use flattening functions to map `hc.Order` to the Terraform order schema.

The read function is named `resourceOrderRead` and starts on line 115. `resourceOrderRead` has already been implemented for you. You will define one of the flattening functions in this step.

## Explore `resourceOrderRead` function

First, the read function retrieves the API client from the meta parameter (line 117).

```
c := m.(*hc.Client)
```

Then, the read function retrieves the resource ID using `d.Id()`.

```
orderID := d.Id()
```

The read function uses this value as an argument in `GetOrder` to retrieve the order's information. If `GetOrder` fails, the provider will error with the API Client's API error message.

```
order, err := c.GetOrder(orderID)
if err != nil {
  return diag.FromErr(err)
}
```

Finally, flattening functions are used to map the response (`hc.Order`) to order `schema.Resource`.

```
orderItems := flattenOrderItems(&order.Items)
if err := d.Set("items", orderItems); err != nil {
  return diag.FromErr(err)
}
```

## Explore flattening functions

The API Client's `GetOrder` function returns an order object that needs to be "flattened" so the provider can accurately map it to the order `schema`. An order consists of an order ID and a list of coffee objects and their respective quantities.

As a result, it must go through two flattening functions:

1. The first flattening function, `flattenOrderItems`, populates the list of coffee objects and their quantities
1. **The second flattening function, `flattenCoffee`, populates the actual coffee object itself.**

The first flattening function has been implemented for you. You will implement `flattenCoffee`, the second flattening function.

### `flattenOrderItems` function 

You can find the  `flattenOrderItems` function on line 205 of the `hashicups/resource_order.go`{{open}}. 

This is the first flattening function to return a list of order items. The `flattenOrderItems` function takes an `*[]hc.OrderItem` as `orderItems`. If `orderItems` is not `nil`, it will iterate through the slice and map its values into a `map[string]interface{}`.

```
func flattenOrderItems(orderItems *[]hc.OrderItem) []interface{} {
	if orderItems != nil {
		ois := make([]interface{}, len(*orderItems), len(*orderItems))

		for i, orderItem := range *orderItems {
			oi := make(map[string]interface{})

			oi["coffee"] = flattenCoffee(orderItem.Coffee)
			oi["quantity"] = orderItem.Quantity

			ois[i] = oi
		}

		return ois
	}

	return make([]interface{}, 0)
}
```

### `flattenCoffee` function 

The second flattening function, `flattenCoffee`, is declared on line 229 of the `hashicups/resource_order.go`{{open}} file. 

The `flattenCoffee` function is called in the first flattening function. It takes a `hc.Coffee` and turns a slice with a single object. Notice how this mirrors the coffee schema â€” a `schema.TypeList` with a maximum of one item.

Map the `coffee` `hc.Coffee` input type to the `c` interface type.

The coffee object has the following attributes: `ID`, `Name`, `Teaser`, `Description`, `Price` and `Image`.

<details style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
<summary>Hint</summary>

Add teh following code snippet to line 233. This maps `coffee` to the `c` interface type.

<pre class="file" data-filename="hashicups/resource_order.go" data-target="insert" data-marker="// ** | Map Coffee attributes">
```
// ** | Map Coffee attributes
	c["id"] = coffee.ID
	c["name"] = coffee.Name
	c["teaser"] = coffee.Teaser
	c["description"] = coffee.Description
	c["price"] = coffee.Price
	c["image"] = coffee.Image
```
</pre>
</details>

## Next steps

You have implemented the read function and both flattening functions. This enables the provider to retrieve the order resource's current state.

In the next step, you will implement the update function.
