The telephone numbers in Switzerland is consisted of 10 digits: **`0xx xxx xx xx`**. The first 3 digits are for the national destination codes (NDC) and 7 digits for the subscriber number.

## Challenge

Create a masking transformation to mask only the subscriber number (the last 7 digits of the phone number). Use **`*`** as the masking character. (No need to worry about the country code.)

## Verification

Do NOT forget to test your solution. You can add the transformations to the `payments` role, or create a new role.
