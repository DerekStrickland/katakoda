# HashiConf EU Digital 2020 - Transform Secrets Engine Workshop

**Vault Enterprise 1.4 with Advanced Data Protection module** introduced the **Transform** secrets engine which handles secure data transformation and tokenization against the provided secrets. Transformation methods encompass NIST vetted cryptographic standards such as [format-preserving encryption (FPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format-preserving_encryption) via [FF3-1](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38g/rev-1/draft) to encode your secrets while maintaining the data format and length. In addition, it can also be pseudonymous transformations of the data through other means such as masking.

This prevents the need for change in the existing database schema.
