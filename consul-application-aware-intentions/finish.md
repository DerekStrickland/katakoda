## Review

In this hands-on lab, you operated a Consul datacenter, deployed using Docker, to configure application aware intentions.

In this tutorial, you:

- Checked your environments initial status and configuration
- Created intentions to permit service communication inside the service mesh
- Configured an ingress gateway and exposed one service outside the mesh
- Created application aware intentions and enabled access only to selected path and resources
