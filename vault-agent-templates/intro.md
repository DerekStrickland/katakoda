[Vault Agent](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/agent/index.html) was first introduced in version 0.10.4 as _Beta_ and it was been improved over time. Now, ***Vault 1.3*** introduced [Vault Agent Templates](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/agent/template/index.html) feature.

You can configure Vault Agent to render [Consul Templates markup](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template#templating-language) language. This makes it even easier to integrate your applications with Vault.
