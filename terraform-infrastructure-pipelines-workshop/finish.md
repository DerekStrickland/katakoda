Thanks for attending the the Terraform **Infrastructure Pipelines Workshop**.

During this scenario, you will accomplished three things using Terraform Cloud
run triggers.

- Deployed a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud.
- Deployed Consul on the Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart
- Deployed Vault (configured to use a Consul backend) on the Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart.

You also verified that this infrastructure is working as described.

Return to the main Zoom meeting for the group Q&A session.
